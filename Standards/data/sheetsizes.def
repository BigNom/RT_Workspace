# in Models dialog box.  The Name column is the name that is displayed in the dialog
# box. The Units column is the units that are used to describe the printable area.
# The names of the units should be the same as the ones used in the Units.def file
# but do not have to match the units that are in the targeted Model. True Scale will
# be applied. The Height and Width columns describe the corresponding dimensions of
# the printable area. Each column must be separated by a semicolon ";".
#
# The location of the sheetsizes.def file can be set with the configuration variable
# MS_CUSTOMSHEETSIZEDEF. The default location of this file is in Workspace\system\data\.
#
#The Roll paper sizes can be used with any roll paper device. The height and width will 
#emulate the size of the paper after it is cut.
#
#The Cut Sheet sizes can be use be used with most sheet paper printers such that the margin is less
#than the maximum printable area that the printing device can produce.
#
#Negative values can be used for any of the margins to move the margins outside of the displayed paper.
